React Scaffold for ChinesePod
============
## Introduction
This is mainly for us to get comfortable with React and to play around and
test new things. So I chose to exclude libraries like 'redux', 'react-router',
'react-router-redux'.

## Installing
Run `npm install` after you've git cloned the repo to your local machine.
This should install all the dependencies needed  for the application to work.

## Set up
Run `npm start` to start the application using Webpack Dev Server, it will
start on http://localhost:7777 and it'll also tell you where

Port can be changed in `webpack.config.babel.js`

## Deploy
Run `npm run build` if you want to build the application into the dist/
directory.
